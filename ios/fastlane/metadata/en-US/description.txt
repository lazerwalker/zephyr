You find a strange game on an old disused phone. It's some sort of adventure game, but it seems to be loading some sort of save file that's already mid-game. You have no idea what your goal is, and nobody seems to be speaking a language you understand. What are you supposed to do?

ｚｅｐｈｙｒ is a game about the joy of exploring and getting lost in incomprehensible systems. The game's goal, and the written language it uses, are procedurally generated for each playthrough.

It was made in (more or less) 52 hours on Train Jam 2019 (http://trainjam.com). All game art is processed FMV (full-motion video) captured on the train.
